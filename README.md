# PrOCoil - Predicting the Oligomerization of Coiled Coil Proteins
The package allows for predicting whether a coiled coil sequence
(amino acid sequence plus heptad register) is more likely to form
a dimer or more likely to form a trimer. Additionally to the
prediction itself, a prediction profile is computed which allows
for determining the strengths to which the individual residues
are indicative for either class. Prediction profiles can also
be visualized as curves or heatmaps.
