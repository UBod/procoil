Change history of package procoil:
==================================

The following list highlights the change history of the package.
It only mentions versions in which actual changes have been made
(leaving out automatic version number increments that have been made
within the Bioconductor release cycle without any actual change
of code or documentation).

Version 2.0.0:
- updated models PrOCoilModel and PrOCoilModelBA that
  have been trained with newer data and up-to-date methods
- general re-design of classes and functions to allow for
  multiple predictions per run; that comes along with
  a more streamlined and more versatile interface how to
  supply sequences and registers to predict().
- predictions and plots are now performed by the 'kebabs'
  package; this led to a major performance increase.
- the integration of the 'kebabs' package also allowed
  for inheriting functions like heatmap() and accessors,
  such as, sequences(), baselines(), and profiles()
- added a fitted() method to allow for easy extraction of
  predictions
- addition of small example model file
  inst/examples/testModel.CCModel
- streamlining/simplification of some man pages
- several corrections and updates of man pages and
  package vignette
- changed vignette building engine from Sweave to knitr
- removal of reference to Git-SVN bridge

Version 1.1.0:

  versions published on the author's institute page
- minor improvements of vignette (accessor functions)
- fixed bug (error when calling predict() on a BString/AAString
  object without previously loading Biostrings)
- fixed bug in predict() for short sequences
