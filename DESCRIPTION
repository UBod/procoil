Description: The procoil package allows to predict whether a
	coiled coil sequence (amino acid sequence plus heptad
	register) is more likely to form a dimer or more likely
	to form a trimer. The predict function not only computes
	the prediction itself, but also a profile which allows to
	determine the strengths to which the individual residues
	are indicative for either class. Profiles can also be
	plotted and exported to files.
